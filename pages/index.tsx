          <p>
            The basic premise of Jerry's democracy is: Everything can be boiled down to{" "}
            <strong>black/white, yes/no, left/right</strong>. (<em>Yeah, I know...</em>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, your <strong>constituents</strong> are organized in two tribes,{" "}
            <span className="text-red-700 font-bold">RED</span> or{" "}
            <span className="text-blue-700 font-bold">BLUE</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The constituents are organized into <strong>districts</strong>. If either of
            the tribe has a majority in the district, the district falls to that tribe (
            <em>"The winner takes it all ðŸŽ¶"</em>). It is <strong>up to you</strong> to
            define the districts such that{" "}
            <strong>
              your tribe wins more districts than the opposite tribe, even though it
              doesn't have the popular vote
            </strong>{" "}
            (simply checking to which tribe each constituent belongs).
          </p>
        </QAndA>
        <QAndA question="What are the rules?">
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>
              Each game shows an n x n grid full of constituents that are either{" "}
              <span className="text-red-700 font-bold">RED</span> or{" "}
              <span className="text-blue-700 font-bold">BLUE</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The description tells you who doesn't have the popular vote. Your job is to
              cut the districts such that you get the majority of districts anyway.
            </li>
            <li>Hard rules:</li>
            <ol className="list-decimal ml-4">
              <li>Districts must be contiguous (no jumps, all parts of the district are connected)</li>
              <li>Each district must have the same amount of constituents</li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
